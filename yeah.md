**Debugging the `opponentUsername` Issue and Server Errors**

I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing difficulties after applying the suggested fixes. Let's address the issues step by step.

---

### **1. Fixing the `NameError: name 'room' is not defined` Error**

The error occurs because the 

room

 variable is not defined within the scope of the `on_join_room` function in your 

app.py

 file. Here's how to fix it:

#### **Ensure 

rooms

 Is Declared as a Global Variable**

At the top of your 

app.py

, declare 

rooms

 as a global dictionary to store game rooms:

```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask, render_template, request, session
from flask_socketio import SocketIO, emit, join_room, leave_room
import datetime

app = Flask(__name__)
socketio = SocketIO(app)

rooms = {}  # Global rooms dictionary
```

#### **Modify the `on_join_room` Function**

Update the `on_join_room` function to correctly reference the 

room

 and 

rooms

 variables:

```python
# app.py
@socketio.on('join_room')
def on_join_room(data):
    code = data['code']
    username = data['username']
    sid = request.sid  # Socket session ID

    # Access the global 'rooms' dictionary
    room = rooms.get(code)
    if room is None:
        emit('error', {'message': 'Room does not exist.'})
        return

    # Initialize 'players' list if it doesn't exist
    if 'players' not in room:
        room['players'] = []

    # Add the player to the room if not already added
    if any(player['username'] == username for player in room['players']):
        # Player already in room; update session ID
        for player in room['players']:
            if player['username'] == username:
                player['sid'] = sid
                break
    else:
        if len(room['players']) >= 2:
            emit('error', {'message': 'Room is full.'})
            return
        player_symbol = 'X' if len(room['players']) == 0 else 'O'
        player = {
            'username': username,
            'symbol': player_symbol,
            'sid': sid
        }
        room['players'].append(player)

    join_room(code)

    # Notify existing players
    emit('player_joined', {'username': username}, room=code)

    # Start the game if two players have joined
    if len(room['players']) == 2:
        player1, player2 = room['players']
        emit('game_start', {
            'symbol': player1['symbol'],
            'opponent': player2['username']
        }, room=player1['sid'])
        emit('game_start', {
            'symbol': player2['symbol'],
            'opponent': player1['username']
        }, room=player2['sid'])
```

**Key Points:**

- **Global Variable Access:**
  - Ensure 

rooms

 is declared globally and accessible within the function.
  - No need to use the `global` keyword unless you're reassigning the 

rooms

 variable itself.

- **Defining 

room

:**
  - Use 

room = rooms.get(code)

 to retrieve the room information.

- **Adding Players:**
  - Check if the player is already in the room to handle reconnections.
  - Limit the room to two players.

---

### **2. Fixing the Game Not Starting Issue**

The game might not start because the server isn't detecting that two players have joined. Here's how to resolve this:

#### **Verify Players Are Added Correctly**

Ensure that each player is correctly added to 

room['players']

:

- Players should be stored as a list of dictionaries containing `username`, `symbol`, and `sid`.

#### **Check the Game Start Condition**

Confirm that the game starts when two players are in the room:

```python
if len(room['players']) == 2:
    # Start the game
```

#### **Debugging Steps**

- **Add Logging Statements:**

  ```python
  print(f"Player {username} joined room {code}.")
  print(f"Players in room {code}: {[player['username'] for player in room['players']]}")
  ```

- **Verify Client-Side Handling:**

  Ensure the client receives the `game_start` event and sets `opponentUsername` correctly.

---

### **3. Correcting the `opponentUsername` Display**

In your client-side JavaScript, make sure that `opponentUsername` is assigned correctly when the `game_start` event is received:

```javascript
// static/tictactoe_game.js
socket.on('game_start', data => {
    playerSymbol = data.symbol;
    opponentUsername = data.opponent;
    currentPlayer = 'X';
    gameActive = true;

    if (playerSymbol === 'X') {
        statusDisplay.textContent = 'Game started. Your turn.';
    } else {
        statusDisplay.textContent = `Game started. Waiting for ${opponentUsername}'s move.`;
    }
});
```

When updating the game status, ensure you're referencing the correct `opponentUsername` variable:

```javascript
// When the opponent wins
statusDisplay.textContent = `${opponentUsername} won!`;
```

---

### **4. Summary of Changes**

- **Server-Side (

app.py

):**
  - Declare 

rooms

 globally.
  - Properly define and use 

room

 within the `on_join_room` function.
  - Ensure players are added to 

room['players']

.
  - Start the game when both players have joined.

- **Client-Side (`tictactoe_game.js`):**
  - Correctly set `opponentUsername` upon receiving the `game_start` event.
  - Update UI elements to reflect the opponent's username accurately.

---

### **5. Additional Notes**

- **Reconnection Handling:**
  - Implement logic to handle players reconnecting to the game.
  
- **Error Handling:**
  - Provide feedback to the client if errors occur (e.g., room doesn't exist, room is full).

- **Testing:**
  - Test the game with two different browsers or devices to simulate two separate players.
  - Monitor console logs on both server and client sides for any errors or unexpected behavior.

---

By making these adjustments, the game should correctly recognize when both players have joined and display the correct opponent's username. The `NameError` should also be resolved with the proper definition and usage of the 

room

 variable.
