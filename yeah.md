1) How do I add a dark-mode button, that works site wide?
2) On local mode, the tictactoe game isn't registering any wins or draws at all, and expects the player to continue even after all squares are filled.


GitHub Copilot: 1. **Adding a Dark Mode Button Site-Wide**

   To add a dark mode toggle button that works across your site:

   - **Add a Toggle Button in Your HTML Template**

     In your `game_template.html`, add a button for toggling dark mode:

     ```html
     <!-- game_template.html -->
     <button id="dark-mode-toggle">Toggle Dark Mode</button>
     ```

     Place this button where you want it to appear on your site.

   - **Define Dark Mode Styles in Your CSS**

     In your 

styles.css

, add styles for dark mode:

     ```css
     /* static/styles.css */
     body.dark-mode {
         background-color: #121212;
         color: #ffffff;
     }

     /* Customize other elements for dark mode as needed */
     ```

   - **Implement Toggle Functionality with JavaScript**

     Create a new JavaScript file `static/dark_mode.js` and add the following code:

     ```javascript
     // static/dark_mode.js
     document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
         const toggleButton = document.getElementById('dark-mode-toggle');
         const currentTheme = localStorage.getItem('theme');

         if (currentTheme === 'dark') {
             document.body.classList.add('dark-mode');
         }

         toggleButton.addEventListener('click', () => {
             document.body.classList.toggle('dark-mode');
             const theme = document.body.classList.contains('dark-mode') ? 'dark' : 'light';
             localStorage.setItem('theme', theme);
         });
     });
     ```

   - **Include the Script in Your HTML Template**

     In your `game_template.html`, include the new JavaScript file:

     ```html
     <!-- game_template.html -->
     <script src="{{ url_for('static', filename='dark_mode.js') }}"></script>
     ```

2. **Fixing Win and Draw Detection in Local Mode**

   To ensure the game registers wins and draws in local mode:

   - **Update the `handleCellClick` Function**

     In your 

tictactoe_game.js

, modify the `handleCellClick` function to check for a winner or a draw after each move:

     ```javascript
     // static/tictactoe_game.js
     function handleCellClick(event) {
         const clickedCell = event.target;
         const clickedCellIndex = parseInt(clickedCell.getAttribute('data-cell-index'));

         if (board[clickedCellIndex] !== '' || !gameActive) {
             return;
         }

         makeMove(clickedCellIndex, currentPlayer);

         const winner = checkWinner();
         if (winner) {
             if (winner === 'Draw') {
                 statusDisplay.textContent = "It's a draw!";
             } else {
                 statusDisplay.textContent = `Player ${winner} wins!`;
             }
             gameActive = false;
             return;
         }

         if (mode === 'ai' && gameActive) {
             currentPlayer = 'O';
             statusDisplay.textContent = "AI's turn";
             setTimeout(aiMove, 500);
         } else if (mode === 'local') {
             currentPlayer = currentPlayer === 'X' ? 'O' : 'X';
             statusDisplay.textContent = `Player ${currentPlayer}'s turn`;
         }
     }
     ```

   - **Ensure `checkWinner` Detects Draws**

     Verify that your `checkWinner` function properly returns `'Draw'` when the board is full and there is no winner:

     ```javascript
     // static/tictactoe_game.js
     function checkWinner() {
         const winningConditions = [
             [0,1,2], [3,4,5], [6,7,8],
             [0,3,6], [1,4,7], [2,5,8],
             [0,4,8], [2,4,6]
         ];

         for (let condition of winningConditions) {
             const [a, b, c] = condition;
             if (board[a] && board[a] === board[b] && board[a] === board[c]) {
                 return board[a];
             }
         }

         return board.includes('') ? null : 'Draw';
     }
     ```

   - **Set 

gameActive

 to `false` When Game Ends**

     Ensure that 

gameActive

 is set to `false` when a win or draw is detected to prevent further moves:

     ```javascript
     // static/tictactoe_game.js
     if (winner) {
         // ... handle win or draw
         gameActive = false;
     }
     ```

   With these changes, the game should correctly detect wins and draws in local mode.

UN7X: New issue,
The online multiplayer mode seems to not be syncing anymore. Now each platyer is 'X', and can click anything until they win, without their opponents moves registering on their own screen. 

GitHub Copilot: **Fixing Online Multiplayer Sync Issues**

The issue with online multiplayer not syncing is due to the 

handleCellClick

 function not properly handling the online mode. To fix this, you need to:

1. **Check if It's the Player's Turn Before Allowing a Move**
2. **Send the Move to the Server to Update Both Players' Boards**

**Update 

handleCellClick

 Function**

Modify the 

handleCellClick

 function in 

tictactoe_game.js

 to handle the online mode correctly:

```javascript
// static/tictactoe_game.js
function handleCellClick(event) {
    const clickedCell = event.target;
    const clickedCellIndex = parseInt(clickedCell.getAttribute('data-cell-index'));

    if (board[clickedCellIndex] !== '' || !gameActive) {
        return;
    }

    if (mode === 'online') {
        // Only proceed if it's the player's turn
        if (currentPlayer !== playerSymbol) {
            return;
        }

        makeMove(clickedCellIndex, playerSymbol);

        const winner = checkWinner();
        if (winner) {
            gameActive = false;
        } else {
            // Switch turns
            currentPlayer = currentPlayer === 'X' ? 'O' : 'X';
        }

        // Send the move to the server
        socket.emit('make_move', {
            code: code,
            board: board,
            currentPlayer: currentPlayer,
            playerSymbol: playerSymbol
        });
    } else {
        // Existing logic for local and AI modes
        makeMove(clickedCellIndex, currentPlayer);

        const winner = checkWinner();
        if (winner) {
            if (winner === 'Draw') {
                statusDisplay.textContent = "It's a draw!";
            } else {
                statusDisplay.textContent = `Player ${winner} wins!`;
            }
            gameActive = false;
            return;
        }

        if (mode === 'ai' && gameActive) {
            currentPlayer = 'O';
            statusDisplay.textContent = "AI's turn";
            setTimeout(aiMove, 500);
        } else if (mode === 'local') {
            currentPlayer = currentPlayer === 'X' ? 'O' : 'X';
            statusDisplay.textContent = `Player ${currentPlayer}'s turn`;
        }
    }
}
```

**Ensure Server Handles 'make_move' Event**

On the server side, make sure you're handling the 'make_move' event and broadcasting the updated board to both players. The server should emit an 'update_board' event after processing a move.

**Update 'update_board' Event Listener**

In your 

tictactoe_game.js

, update the 'update_board' event listener to handle the board updates:

```javascript
// static/tictactoe_game.js
socket.on('update_board', data => {
    board = data.board;
    currentPlayer = data.currentPlayer;
    updateBoard();

    if (data.winner) {
        if (data.winningLine) {
            data.winningLine.forEach(index => {
                cells[index].classList.add('winner');
            });
        }
        if (data.winner === playerSymbol) {
            statusDisplay.textContent = 'You won!';
        } else if (data.winner === 'Draw') {
            statusDisplay.textContent = "It's a draw!";
        } else {
            statusDisplay.textContent = `${opponentUsername} won!`;
        }
        gameActive = false;
    } else {
        if (currentPlayer === playerSymbol) {
            statusDisplay.textContent = 'Your turn';
        } else {
            statusDisplay.textContent = `It's ${opponentUsername}'s turn`;
        }
    }
});
```

**Verify Player Symbols**

Ensure that each player receives the correct 

playerSymbol

 ('X' or 'O') when the game starts:

```javascript
// static/tictactoe_game.js
socket.on('game_start', data => {
    playerSymbol = data.symbol; // 'X' or 'O'
    opponentUsername = data.opponent;
    currentPlayer = 'X';
    gameActive = true;

    statusDisplay.textContent = playerSymbol === 'X' ? 'Game started. Your turn.' : `Game started. Waiting for ${opponentUsername}'s move.`;
});
```

**Prevent Players from Moving Out of Turn**

In the 

handleCellClick

 function, the check `if (currentPlayer !== playerSymbol)` ensures that players can only make a move when it's their turn.

By implementing these changes, the online multiplayer mode should synchronize correctly, with players taking turns and moves being updated across both clients.

UN7X: Big task:
1) the ´´´statusDisplay.textContent = `Game started. It's ${opponentUsername}'s turn.`;´´´ AND ´´´statusDisplay.textContent = `${opponentUsername} won!`;´´´ code is still producing the user's username, instead of their opponent's username. fix it.

After fixing the above, using the existing framework, make:
1) A chess game,
2) A checkers game,
3) A grid-based snake game with multiplayer (slither.io) and singleplayer (regular snake) support, and accepts WASD, arrow keys, or on-screen controls for control on mobile devices.

Beware, the current code may explicitly link to tictactoe only, instead of being modular and dynamic, if you find any code that does so, fix it.
#codebase 

GitHub Copilot: **Fixing the 

opponentUsername

 Issue**

The problem occurs because 

opponentUsername

 is being set to the user's own username instead of the opponent's. To fix this, ensure that the server correctly assigns and sends the opponent's username to each client.

**Update Server-Side Code**

In your server code (e.g., 

app.py

), when emitting the `game_start` event to each player, send the opponent's username:

```python
# Server-side code snippet
@socketio.on('join_room')
def on_join_room(data):
    code = data['code']
    username = data['username']
    room = rooms.get(code)
    # Add player to the room and assign 'X' or 'O'
    # ...

    # Once both players have joined
    if len(room['players']) == 2:
        players = list(room['players'].values())
        player1, player2 = players[0], players[1]
        # Send 'game_start' event to player1
        emit('game_start', {
            'symbol': player1['symbol'],
            'opponent': player2['username']
        }, room=player1['sid'])
        # Send 'game_start' event to player2
        emit('game_start', {
            'symbol': player2['symbol'],
            'opponent': player1['username']
        }, room=player2['sid'])
```

**Update Client-Side Code**

In 

tictactoe_game.js

, ensure 

opponentUsername

 is set correctly:

```javascript
// static/tictactoe_game.js
socket.on('game_start', data => {
    playerSymbol = data.symbol; // 'X' or 'O'
    opponentUsername = data.opponent; // Correct opponent username
    currentPlayer = 'X';
    gameActive = true;

    if (playerSymbol === 'X') {
        statusDisplay.textContent = 'Game started. Your turn.';
    } else {
        statusDisplay.textContent = `Game started. Waiting for ${opponentUsername}'s move.`;
    }
});
```

Now, 

statusDisplay

 will show the correct opponent's username.

**Extending the Framework for Multiple Games**

To add Chess, Checkers, and Snake games while making the code modular and dynamic:

**1. Refactor the Game Structure**

- **Create a Generic Game Template**

  ```html
  <!-- templates/game_template.html -->
  <!DOCTYPE html>
  <html>
  <head>
      <title>{{ game_name.title() }} Game</title>
      <link rel="stylesheet" href="{{ url_for('static', filename=game_name + '/styles.css') }}">
  </head>
  <body>
      <div id="game-container">
          {% block game_content %}{% endblock %}
      </div>
      <script>
          const mode = "{{ mode }}";
          const username = "{{ username }}";
      </script>
      <script src="{{ url_for('static', filename=game_name + '/game.js') }}"></script>
  </body>
  </html>
  ```

- **Dynamic Routing in Flask**

  ```python
  # app.py
  @app.route('/game/<game_name>')
  def game(game_name):
      return render_template('game_template.html', game_name=game_name, mode='online', username=session['username'])
  ```

**2. Organize Static Files**

- **Create Separate Folders for Each Game**

  ```
  static/
    chess/
      game.js
      styles.css
    checkers/
      game.js
      styles.css
    snake/
      game.js
      styles.css
  ```

**3. Implement Each Game**

- **Chess Game**

  - **Frontend (`static/chess/game.js`):**

    - Implement an 8x8 board using HTML and CSS.
    - Define piece movement logic and game rules in JavaScript.
    - Handle user interactions and update the UI accordingly.

  - **Backend (`app.py`):**

    - Manage game states and synchronize moves between players using Socket.IO events.

- **Checkers Game**

  - **Frontend (`static/checkers/game.js`):**

    - Similar to Chess, implement an 8x8 board with alternating colored squares.
    - Define movement and capturing logic for checkers pieces.
    - Manage kinging and jumps.

  - **Backend (`app.py`):**

    - Handle move validation and synchronization between clients.

- **Snake Game**

  - **Frontend (`static/snake/game.js`):**

    - Create a grid-based game area.
    - Implement the snake's movement and growth logic.
    - Support both single-player and multiplayer modes.
    - Add controls for WASD, arrow keys, and on-screen buttons for mobile.

  - **Backend (`app.py`):**

    - For multiplayer, manage the game state and broadcast updates to all players.
    - Handle player connections and disconnections.

**4. Update Socket.IO Handlers**

- **Modify Event Names and Logic**

  - Use dynamic event names or include the game type in your events to handle multiple games.

  ```javascript
  // Example for handling moves
  socket.on(`${gameName}_move`, data => {
      // Handle move based on gameName
  });
  ```

**5. Ensure Modularity**

- **Abstract Common Functionality**

  - Create common modules for shared logic (e.g., user authentication, chat functionality).

- **Avoid Hardcoding Game-Specific Values**

  - Use variables and configurations to define game-specific parameters.

By following these steps, you can extend your framework to accommodate new games while keeping the codebase organized and maintainable.
